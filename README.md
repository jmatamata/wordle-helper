# wordle-helper
N-letter word generator that can aid in the game of Wordle.

Have you ever had trouble coming up with 5 letter words for the game of wordle? Well I did. So I built a n-word generator that spits out posible words given usual wordle game constraints.

This application uses Python 3.10 and the pyenchant library to validate english words.

The application is used by using a text file and the special syntax to input word constraints.
